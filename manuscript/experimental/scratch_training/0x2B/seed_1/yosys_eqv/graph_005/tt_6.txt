11. Executing SAT pass (solving SAT problems in the circuit).

Setting up SAT problem:
Import set-constraint: \_0 = 1'1
Import set-constraint: \_1 = 1'1
Import set-constraint: \_2 = 1'0
Final constraint equation: { \_2 \_1 \_0 } = 3'011
Imported 10 cells to SAT database.
Import show expression: \_13
Import show expression: \_0
Import show expression: \_1
Import show expression: \_2
Import show expression: \_13

Solving problem with 56 variables and 138 clauses..
