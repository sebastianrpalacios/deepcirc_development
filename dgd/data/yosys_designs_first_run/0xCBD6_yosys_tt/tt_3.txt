8. Executing SAT pass (solving SAT problems in the circuit).

Setting up SAT problem:
Import set-constraint: \_0 = 1'0
Import set-constraint: \_1 = 1'0
Import set-constraint: \_2 = 1'1
Import set-constraint: \_3 = 1'1
Final constraint equation: { \_3 \_2 \_1 \_0 } = 4'1100
Imported 21 cells to SAT database.
Import show expression: \_1230
Import show expression: \_0
Import show expression: \_1
Import show expression: \_2
Import show expression: \_3
Import show expression: \_1230

Solving problem with 107 variables and 267 clauses..
